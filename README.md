# PHPDoge
PHPDoge is an extensive PHP library that supports a custom Doge minified compiler, API connections to Doge, and everything essential to land on the moon.

## Usage
### Run commands
  * You can run commands by accessing the **doge.php** file and adding the GET request "c" (Command) containing your DOGE code
    * Example https://foobar.com/doge.php?c=dogeSay'Hello'.
    * This will convert the "Dogecode"TM into PHP realtime!

### Hello
  * Wow
