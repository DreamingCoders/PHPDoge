# PHPDoge
PHPDoge is an extensive PHP library/framework that supports a custom Doge minified compiler, API connections to Doge, and everything essential to land on the moon.

## Purpose
At first I wanted to make custom Doge commands in PHP, but now I am making this a "framework" that simplifies PHP functions
By making for example queries run seamlessly.
I intend to make PHPDoge light meaning it will be minimal and very fast to run in contrast to other frameworks like Laravel.

## Usage
### Run commands
  * You can run commands by accessing the **doge.php** file and adding the GET request "c" (Command) containing your DOGE code
    * Example https://foobar.com/doge.php?c=dogeSay'Hello'.
    * This will convert the "Dogecode"TM into PHP realtime!

### Hello
  * Wow
  * Fun fact: I wasn't intending to make PHPDoge a framework. I personally do not like frameworks instead raw PHP without an MVC
   * I am intending on making it functional for those who prefer MVC's or none through multiple transports
